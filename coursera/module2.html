			Chicken

		Chicken drumsticks laced with delicate flavors of cream, milk, saffron, rose petals and mild spices. This recipe is not made with oil or ghee; but it will definitely make a great start to your festive cheer. Make sure you garnish the dish with raw almonds that only enhance the dish's flavour.

			Beef
		</div>
		<p>
		   Mongolian Beef is a recipe that Iâ€™ve been cooking for clients for many years for a number of reasons. One, people love anything that tastes like Chinese takeout. Two, the sweet flavor of the dark brown sugar mixed with the salty soy sauce and the strong ginger and garlic is incredibly addicting and three you get to enjoy it over a mountain of steamed rice, which if you are anything like me is your happy place.
